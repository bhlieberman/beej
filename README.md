# README

This is an attempt to learn Haskell by following along with [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/index.html). I'm tired of Advent of Code and trivial example code in tutorials. I wanted a meaningful way to interact with a broad range of fundamental language features and this is it. It's files all the way down.
